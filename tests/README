nvmetests
=========

    This contains a NVMe tests framework. The purpose of this framework
    to use nvme cli and test various supported commands and scenarios for
    NVMe device.

    In current implementation this framework uses nvme-cli to
    interact with underlying controller/namespace.

    Note these tests expect to run against real hardware and will
    read and write data to /dev/nvme0!

    DO NOT RUN THEM IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

    You have been warned.

1. Common Package Dependencies
------------------------------

    1. Python(>= 3.3)
    2. nose2 (Installation guide http://nose2.readthedocs.io/)
    3. flake8 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8)
    4. mypy (https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)
    5. autopep8 (https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)
    6. isort (https://pypi.org/project/isort/)

    Python package management system pip can be used to install most of the
    listed packages(https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) :-
    $ pip install nose2 flake8 mypy autopep8 isort

2. Overview
-----------

    This framework follows simple class hierarchy. Each test file contains
    one test. Each test is direct subclass or indirect subclass of TestNVMe
    class which represents one testcase. To write a new testcase one can copy
    existing template "nvme_simple_template_test.py" and start adding new
    testcase specific functionality. For detailed information please look into
    section 3.

    For more information about tests, class hierarchy and code please refer :-

    1. Documentation :- html/
    2. Class Index :-  html/index.html
    3. Class Hierarchy :- html/class-tree.html

    For each testcase it will create log directory mentioned in
    configuration file. This directory will be used for a temporary files
    and storing execution logs of each testcases. Current implementation stores
    stdout and stderr for each testcase under log directory, e.g. :-

        $ tree nvmetests/
        nvmetests/
        ├── TestNVMeAttachDetachNSCmd
        │   ├── stderr.log
        │   └── stdout.log
        ├── TestNVMeFlushCmd
        │   ├── stderr.log
        │   └── stdout.log
        └── TestNVMeFormatCmd
            ├── stderr.log
            └── stdout.log
                 .
                 .
                 .

3. Walk-Through Example for writing a new testcase
--------------------------------------------------
    1. Copy simple test template file from current directory
       with appropriate name, replace "simple_template" with testcase name
       in new file name. Update config.json if necessary.
    2. Write a testcase main function, make sure its name is starting with
       test_*.
    3. Based on the requirement one can inherit TestNVMe or TestNVMeIO
       class.
    4. Write test precondition code into setUp. Make sure you are calling
       super class setUp.
    5. Write test post condition code into tearDown. Make sure you are calling
       super class tearDown.
    6. Before writing a new function have a look into TestNVMe to see if it
       can be reused.
    7. Once testcase is ready make sure :-
           a. Run flake8, mypy, autopep8 and isort on the testcase and fix
	      errors/warnings.
               - Example "$ ninja -C .build lint-python" will run flake8 and
	         mypy on all the python files in current directory.
	       - Example "$ ninja -C .build format-python" will run autopep8 and
	         isort on all the python files in the current directory.

4. Running testcases with framework
-----------------------------------
    1. Running single testcase (in the source tree) with nose2 :-
       $ nose2 --verbose --start-dir tests nvme_writezeros_test
       $ nose2 --verbose --start-dir tests nvme_read_write_test

    2. Running all the testcases (in the build root directory) with ninja :-
       $ ninja test -C .build
