.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Send a customized NVMe Admin command request message and get the corresponding
response message.

This interface supports no data, host to controller and controller to
host but it doesn't support bidirectional data transfer.
Also this interface only supports data transfer size range [0, 4096] (bytes)
so the & data_len parameter must be less than 4097.
.SH "RETURN"
The nvme command status if a response was received (see
\fIenum nvme_status_field\fP) or -1 with errno set otherwise.
