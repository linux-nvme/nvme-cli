.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In order to be able to log from code paths where no root object is passed in
via the arguments use the the default one which can be set via this call.
When creating a new root object with \fInvme_create_root\fP the global root object
will be set as well. This means the global root object is always pointing to
the latest created root object. Note the first \fInvme_free_tree\fP call will reset
the global root object.
