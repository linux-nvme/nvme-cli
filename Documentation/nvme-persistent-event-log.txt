NAME
----
nvme-persistent-event-log - Send NVMe persistent event log page request,
returns result and log

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme persistent-event-log' <device> [--action=<action> | -a <action>]
            [--log-len=<log-len> | -l <log-len>]
            [--raw-binary | -b]
            [--output-format=<fmt> | -o <fmt>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves the NVMe persistent event log page from an NVMe device
and provides the returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the returned persistent event log structure may be returned
in one of several ways depending on the option flags; the structure may
parsed by the program and printed in a readable format or the raw buffer
may be printed to stdout for another program to parse.

OPTIONS
-------
-a <action>::
--action=<action>::
    While try to retrieve this log action the controller shall take
    during processing this persistent log page command. This mandatory
    field, based on the value issued it may Read Log Data, Establish
    Context and Read Log Data or Release Context can occur. For More
    details see NVM Express 1.4 Spec. Section 5.14.1.13 Persistent
    Event Log (Log Identifier 0Dh)

-l <log-len>::
--log-len=<log-len>::
    Allocates a buffer of <log-len> bytes size and requests this
    many bytes be returned in the constructed NVMe command. This
    param is mandatory. If <log-len> given is 0 and action is 0,
    it will read the Total Log Length(TLL) of the page.

-b::
--raw-binary::
    Print the raw persistent event log buffer to stdout.

-o <format>::
--output-format=<format>::
    Set the reporting format to 'normal', 'json', or 'binary'.
    Only one output format can be used at a time.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Print the persistent event log page in a human readable format:
+
------------
# nvme persistent-event-log /dev/nvme0
------------
+

* Print the raw persistent event log to a file:
+
------------
# nvme persistent-event-log /dev/nvme0 --raw-binary > persistent_log.raw
------------
+
It is probably a bad idea to not redirect stdout when using this mode.
