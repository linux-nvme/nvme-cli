nvme-security-send - Security Send command

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme security-send' <device> [--file=<file> | -f <file>]
		    [--secp=<security-protocol> | -p <security-protocol>]
		    [--spsp=<protocol-specific> | -s <protocol-specific>]
		    [--tl=<transfer-length> | -t <transfer-length>]
		    [--nssf=<nvme-specific> | -N <nvme-specific>]
		    [--namespace-id=<nsid> | -n <nsid>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Security Send command is used to transfer security protocol data
to the controller. The data structure transferred to the controller
as part of this command contains security protocol specific commands
to be performed by the controller. The data structure transferred may
also contain data or parameters associated with the security protocol
commands. Status and data that is to be returned to the host for the
security protocol commands submitted by a Security Send command are
retrieved with the Security Receive command.

The association between a Security Send command and subsequent Security
Receive command is Security Protocol field dependent as defined in SPC-4.

OPTIONS
-------
-n <nsid>::
--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Target a specific namespace for this security command.

-N <nssf>::
--nssf=<nssf>::
	NVMe Security Specific field. If using security protocol EAh
	assigned for NVMe use, the NVMe security specific field indicates
	which reply memory buffer target.

-f <file>::
--file=<file>::
	Path to file used as the security protocol's payload. Required
	argument.

-p <security-protocol>::
--secp=<security-protocol>::
	Security Protocol: This field specifies the security protocol
	as defined in SPC-4. The controller shall fail the command with
	Invalid Parameter indicated if a reserved value of the Security
	Protocol is specified.

-s <security-protocol-specific>::
--spsp=<security-protocol-specific>::
	SP Specific: The value of this field is specific to the Security
	Protocol as defined in SPC-4.

-t <trans-length>::
--tl=<trans-length>::
	Transfer Length: The value of this field is specific to the
