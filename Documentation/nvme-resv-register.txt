[verse]
'nvme resv-register' <device> [--namespace-id=<nsid> | -n <nsid>]
			      [--crkey=<crkey> | -c <crkey>]
			      [--nrkey=<nrkey> | -k <nrkey>]
			      [--rrega=<rrega> | -r <rrega>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Reservation Register command is used to register, unregister, or
replace a reservation key.

OPTIONS
-------
-n <nsid>::
--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Override the nsid field. If using the admin character device,
	this parameter is required.

-c <crkey>::
--crkey=<crkey>::
	Current Reservation Key: If the Reservation Register Action is
	001b (i.e., Unregister Reservation Key) or 010b (i.e., Replace
	Reservation Key), then this field contains the current reservation
	key associated with the host. For all other Reservation Register
	Action values, this field is reserved. The controller ignores
	the value of this field when the Ignore Existing Key (IEKEY)
	bit is set to ‘1’.

-k <nrkey>::
--nrkey=<nrkey>::
	New Reservation Key: If the Reservation Register Action is
	000b (i.e., Register Reservation Key) or 010b (i.e., Replace
	Reservation Key), then this field contains the new reservation
	key associated with the host. For all other Reservation Register
	Action values, this field is reserved.

-p <cptpl>::
--cptpl=<cptpl>::
	Change Persist Through Power Loss State: This field allows the
	Persist Through Power Loss state associated with the namespace
	to be modified as a side effect of processing this command.
+
[]

|Value|Definition
|0|No change to PTPL state
|1|Reserved
|2|Set PTPL state to ‘0’. Reservations are released and registrants
are cleared on a power on.

a power loss.
|=================

-a <rrega>::
--rrega=<rrega>::
	Reservation Register Action: This field specifies the registration
	action that is performed by the command.

|1|Unregister Reservation Key
|2|Replace Reservation Key
|3-7|Reserved
|=================

-i::
--iekey::
	Ignore Existing Key: If this bit is set to a '1', then the
	Current Reservation Key (CRKEY) check is disabled and the command
	shall succeed regardless of the CRKEY field value.
+
Indicator option, defaults to '0'.
