NAME
----
nvme-security-recv - Security Recv command

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme security-recv' [<device>] [--size=<size> | -x <size>]
		    [--secp=<security-protocol> | -p <security-protocol>]
		    [--spsp=<protocol-specific> | -s <protocol-specific>]
		    [--nssf=<nvme-specific> | -N <nvme-specific>]
		    [--tl=<transfer-length> | -t <transfer-length>]
		    [--namespace-id=<nsid> | -n <nsid>]
		    [-b | --raw-binary]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Security Receive command transfers the status and data result of
one or more Security Send commands that were previously submitted to
the controller.

The association between a Security Receive command and previous Security
Send commands is dependent on the Security Protocol. The format of the
data to be transferred is dependent on the Security Protocol. Refer to
SPC-4 for Security Protocol details.

Each Security Receive command returns the appropriate data corresponding
to a Security Send command as defined by the rules of the Security
Protocol. The Security Receive command data may not be retained if there
is a loss of communication between the controller and host, or if a
controller reset occurs.

OPTIONS
-------
-n <nsid>::
--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Target a specific namespace for this security command.

-N <nssf>::
--nssf=<nssf>::
	NVMe Security Specific field. If using security protocol EAh
	assigned for NVMe use, the NVMe security specific field indicates
	which reply memory buffer target.

-x <size>::
--size=<size>::
	Size of buffer to allocate. One success it will be printed
	to STDOUT.

-p <security-protocol>::
--secp=<security-protocol>::
	Security Protocol: This field specifies the security protocol
	as defined in SPC-4. The controller shall fail the command with
	Invalid Parameter indicated if a reserved value of the Security
	Protocol is specified.

-s <security-protocol-specific>::
--spsp=<security-protocol-specific>::
	SP Specific: The value of this field is specific to the Security
	Protocol as defined in SPC-4.

-a <allocation-length>::
--al=<allocation-length>::
	Allocation Length: The value of this field is specific to the
	Security Protocol as defined in SPC-4.

-b::
