=====================

NAME
----
nvme-self-test-log - Retrieve the log information initited by device-self-test and display it

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme self-test'-log <device> [--log-entries=<entries> | -e <entries>]
                    [--output-format=<FMT> | -o <FMT>] 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves the log pages from an NVMe device corresponding to the 
requested self-test by the user and provides 20-most recent result 
returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the returned log structure may be returned in one of
several ways depending on the option flags; the structure may parsed by
the program and printed in a readable format or the raw buffer or the 
json format.

By default the log is printed out in the normal readable format.

OPTION
-------
-e <entries>::
--log-entries=<entries>::
	Specifies how many DST log entries the program should request from
	the device. This must be at least one, and shouldn't exceed the
	20 entries. Defaults to 20 DST log entries.

-o <format>::
--output-format=<format>::
              Set the reporting format to 'normal', 'json', or
              'binary'. Only one output format can be used at a time.
