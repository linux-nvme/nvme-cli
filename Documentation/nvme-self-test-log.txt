SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme self-test'-log <device> [--output-format=<FMT> | -o <FMT>] 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves the log pages from an NVMe device corresponding to the 
requested self-test by the user and provides 20-most recent result 
returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the returned log structure may be returned in one of
several ways depending on the option flags; the structure may parsed by
the program and printed in a readable format or the raw buffer or the 
json format.

By default the log is printed out in the normal readable format.
