NAME
----
nvme-sanitize - Send NVMe Sanitize Command, return result

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme sanitize' <device> [--no-dealloc | -d] [--oipbp | -i]
			[--owpass=<overwrite-pass-count> | -n <overwrite-pass-count>]
			[--ause | -u] [--sanact=<action> | -a <action>]
			[--ovrpat=<overwrite-pattern> | -p <overwrite-pattern>]
			[--emvs | -e] [--force]
			[--output-format=<fmt> | -o <fmt>] [--verbose | -v]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, sends a Sanitize command and
provides the result.

The <device> parameter is mandatory NVMe character device (ex: /dev/nvme0).

On success it returns 0, error code otherwise.

OPTIONS
-------
-d::
--no-dealloc::
	No Deallocate After Sanitize:
	If set, then the controller shall not deallocate any logical
	blocks as a result of successfully completing the sanitize
	operation. If cleared, then the controller should deallocate
	logical blocks as a result of successfully completing the
	sanitize operation. This bit shall be ignored if the Sanitize
	Action field is set to 001b (i.e., Exit Failure Mode).

-i::
--oipbp::
	Overwrite Invert Pattern Between Passes:
	If set, then the Overwrite Pattern shall be inverted between
	passes. If cleared, then the overwrite pattern shall not be
	inverted between passes. This bit shall be ignored unless the
	Sanitize Action field is set to 011b (i.e., Overwrite).

-n <overwrite-pass-count>::
--owpass=<overwrite-pass-count>::
	Overwrite Pass Count:
	This field specifies the number of overwrite passes (i.e.,
	how many times the media is to be overwritten) using the data
	from the Overwrite Pattern field of this command. A value of 0
	specifies 16 overwrite passes. This field shall be ignored
	unless the Sanitize Action field is set to 011b (i.e., Overwrite).

-u::
--ause::
	Allow Unrestricted Sanitize Exit:
	If set, then the sanitize operation is performed in unrestricted
	completion mode. If cleared then the sanitize operation is
	performed in restricted completion mode. This bit shall be ignored
	if the Sanitize Action field is set to 001b (i.e., Exit Failure Mode).

-a <action>::
--sanact=<action>::
	Sanitize Action:
+
[]
|=================
|Value|Definition
|0x00| Reserved
|0x01 \| 'exit-failure'| Exit Failure Mode
|0x02 \| 'start-block-erase'| Start a Block Erase sanitize operation
|0x03 \| 'start-overwrite'| Start an Overwrite sanitize operation
|0x04 \| 'start-crypto-erase'| Start a Crypto Erase sanitize operation
|0x05 \| 'exit-media-verification'| Exit Media Verification State
|=================

-p <overwrite-pattern>::
--ovrpat=<overwrite-pattern>::
	Overwrite Pattern:
	This field is ignored unless the Sanitize Action field in
	Command Dword 10 is set to 011b (i.e., Overwrite). This field
	specifies a 32-bit pattern that is used for the Overwrite
	sanitize operation.

-e::
--emvs::
	Enter Media Verification State:
	If set, then the Media Verification state shall be entered if sanitize
	processing completes successfully. If cleared, then this bit shall have
	no effect. If SANACT field does not specify starting a sanitize operation
	(i.e., is set to any value other than 010b, 011b, or 100b), then this bit
	shall be ignored by the controller.

--force::
	Ignore namespace is currently busy and performed the operation
	even though.

-o <fmt>::
--output-format=<fmt>::
	Set the reporting format to 'normal', 'json' or 'binary'. Only one
	output format can be used at a time.

-v::
--verbose::
	Increase the information detail in the output.
