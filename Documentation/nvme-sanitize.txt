NAME
----
nvme-sanitize - Send NVMe Sanitize Command, return result

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme sanitize' <device> [--no-dealloc | -d]
              [--oipbp | -i]
              [--owpass=<overwrite-pass-count> | -n <overwrite-pass-count>]
              [--ause | -u]
              [--sanact=<action> | -a <action>]
              [--ovrpat=<overwrite-pattern> | -p <overwrite-pattern>]
	      [--force]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, sends a Sanitize command and
provides the result.

The <device> parameter is mandatory NVMe character device (ex: /dev/nvme0).

On success it returns 0, error code otherwise.

OPTIONS
-------
-d::
--no-dealloc::
    No Deallocate After Sanitize:
    If set, then the controller shall not deallocate any logical
    blocks as a result of successfully completing the sanitize
    operation. If cleared, then the controller should deallocate
    logical blocks as a result of successfully completing the
    sanitize operation.  This bit shall be ignored if the Sanitize
    Action field is set to 001b (i.e., Exit Failure Mode).

-i::
--oipbp::
    Overwrite Invert Pattern Between Passes:
    If set, then the Overwrite Pattern shall be inverted between
    passes. If cleared, then the overwrite pattern shall not be
    inverted between passes. This bit shall be ignored unless the
    Sanitize Action field is set to 011b (i.e., Overwrite).

-n <overwrite-pass-count>::
--owpass=<overwrite-pass-count>::
    Overwrite Pass Count:
    This field specifies the number of overwrite passes (i.e.,
    how many times the media is to be overwritten) using the data
    from the Overwrite Pattern field of this command. A value of 0
    specifies 16 overwrite passes. This field shall be ignored
    unless the Sanitize Action field is set to 011b (i.e., Overwrite).

-u::
--ause::
    Allow Unrestricted Sanitize Exit:
    If set, then the sanitize operation is performed in unrestricted
    completion mode. If cleared then the sanitize operation is
    performed in restricted completion mode. This bit shall be ignored
    if the Sanitize Action field is set to 001b (i.e., Exit Failure Mode).

-a <action>::
--sanact=<action>::
    Sanitize Action:
    000b - Reserved
    001b - Exit Failure Mode
    010b - Start a Block Erase sanitize operation
    011b - Start an Overwrite sanitize operation
    100b - Start a Crypto Erase sanitize operation

-p <overwrite-pattern>::
--ovrpat=<overwrite-pattern>::
    Overwrite Pattern:
    This field is ignored unless the Sanitize Action field in
    Command Dword 10 is set to 011b (i.e., Overwrite). This field
    specifies a 32-bit pattern that is used for the Overwrite
    sanitize operation.

--force::
    Ignore namespace is currently busy and performed the operation
    even though.
