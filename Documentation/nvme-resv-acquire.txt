SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme resv-acquire' <device>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Reservation Acquire command is used to acquire a reservation on
a namespace, preempt a reservation held on a namespace, and abort a
reservation held on a namespace.

OPTIONS
-------
-n <nsid>::
--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Override the nsid field. If using the admin character device,
	this parameter is required.

-c <crkey>::
--crkey=<crkey>::
	Current Reservation Key: The field specifies the current
	reservation key associated with the host. If the IEKEY bit is
	set to ‘1’ in the command, then the CRKEY check succeeds
	regardless of the value in this field.

-p <prkey>::
--prkey=<prkey>::
	Preempt Reservation Key: If the Reservation Acquire Action is set
	to 001b (i.e., Preempt) or 010b (i.e., Preempt and Abort), then
	this field specifies the reservation key to be unregistered from
	the namespace. For all other Reservation Acquire Action values,
	this field is reserved.

-t <rtype>::
--rtyep=<rtype>::
	Reservation Type: This field specifies the type of reservation
	to be created.
