NAME
----
nvme-dim - Send Discovery Information Management command to one or more Discovery Controllers.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme dim'
		[--task=<task>     | -t <task>]
		[--nqn=<nqn>       | -n <nqn>]
		[--device=<device> | -d <device>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Send Discovery Information Management (DIM) command to one or more Discovery
Controllers. The DIM command allows performing two types of tasks: register or
deregister.

The DIM command is used to explicitly register with Discovery Controllers (DC),
especially with Central Discovery Controllers (CDC). CDCs maintain a database (DB)
of all the Hosts and Storage Subsystems in a network. The register task is used
to add a host to the CDC's DB. The deregister task is used to remove a host from
the CDC's DB.

During a register operation the host will send mandatory information such as the
Host's NQN and ID, as well as the Host's hostname and the Operating System's
version that it is running on. There is also an optional Host Symbolic Name
that can be registered with the CDC.

This command can only be applied to existing DC connections previously created
with the nvme-discover(1) command using the --persistent option.

OPTIONS
-------
-t <task>::
--task <task>::
	The task to perform: "register" or "deregister".

-n <subnqn>::
--nqn <nqn>::
	The DIM command will be sent to the Discovery Controller (DC) matching this
	NQN. A list of comma-separated NQNs can be supplied to apply the command to
	more than one DC.

-d <device>::
--device <device>::
	The DIM command will be sent to the Discovery Controllers (DC) associated
	with this NVMe device handle. A list of comma-separated device handles can
	be supplied to apply the command to more than one DC.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Register with the Central Discovery Controller (CDC) named
nqn.1988-11.com.dell:SFSS:1:20220118125153e8:
+
------------
# nvme dim --task=register --nqn=nqn.1988-11.com.dell:SFSS:1:20220118125153e8

* Deregister from Central Discovery Controller (CDC) associated with nvme4
