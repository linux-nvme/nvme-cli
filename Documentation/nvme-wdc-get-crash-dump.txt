NAME
----
nvme-wdc-get-crash-dump - Retrieve WDC device's crash dump.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme wdc get-crash-dump' <device> [--output-file=<FILE>, -o <FILE>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, sends the WDC vendor unique crash dump
request and saves the result to file. In current implementation crash dump is
captured if it is present. On success it will save the dump in file with
appropriate suffix. Note that this command will clear the available
dump from the device on success.

The <device> parameter is mandatory NVMe character device (ex: /dev/nvme0).

This will only work on WDC devices supporting this feature.
Results for any other device are undefined.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <FILE>::
--output-file=<FILE>::
	Output file; defaults to device serial number followed by "crash_dump" suffix

EXAMPLES
--------
* Gets the crash dump from the device and saves to default file in current directory (e.g. STM00019F3F9crash_dump.bin):
+
------------
# nvme wdc get-crash-dump /dev/nvme0
------------
* Gets the crash dump from the device and saves to defined file in current directory (e.g. testSTM00019F3F9crash_dump.bin):
+
------------
# nvme wdc get-crash-dump /dev/nvme0 -o test
------------
* Gets the crash dump from the device and saves to defined file with pathname (e.g. /tmp/testSTM00019F3F9crash_dump.bin):
