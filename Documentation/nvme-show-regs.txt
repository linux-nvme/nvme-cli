=============

NAME
----
nvme-show-regs - Reads and shows the defined NVMe controller registers for
NVMe over PCIe or the controller properties for NVMe over Fabrics.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme show-regs' <device> [--human-readable | -H]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe over PCIe device given, sends an identify namespace command and
provides the result and returned structure.
For the NVMe over Fabrics device given, sends a fabric command and provides
the result and returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and must be the nvme admin character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0). For NVMe over PCIe, the program uses knowledge of the
sysfs layout to map the device to the pci resource stored there and mmaps the
memory to get access to the registers. For NVMe over Fabrics, the programs
sends a fabric command to get the properties of the target NVMe controller.
Only the supported properties are displayed.

OPTIONS
-------
-H::
--human-readable::
       Display registers or supported properties in human readable format.


EXAMPLES
--------
* Show the NVMe over PCIe controller registers or the NVMe over Fabric controller
properties in a binary format:
+
------------
# nvme show-regs /dev/nvme0
------------
* Show the NVMe over PCIe controller registers or the NVMe over Fabric controller
properties in a human readable format:
+
------------
# nvme show-regs /dev/nvme0 -H
