==========================

NAME
----
nvme-wdc-get-pfail-dump - Retrieve WDC device's pfail crash dump.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme wdc get-pfail-dump' <device> [--output-file=<FILE>, -o <FILE>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, sends the WDC vendor unique pfail crash dump
request and saves the result to file. In current implementation pfail crash
dump is captured if it is present. On success it will save the dump in file 
with appropriate suffix. Note that this command will clear the available
dump from the device on success.

The <device> parameter is mandatory NVMe character device (ex: /dev/nvme0).

This will only work on WDC devices supporting this feature.
Results for any other device are undefined.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <FILE>::
--output-file=<FILE>::
	Output file; defaults to device serial number followed by "pfail_dump" suffix

EXAMPLES
--------
* Gets the pfail crash dump from the device and saves to default file in current directory 
(e.g. STM00019F3F9_pfail_dump.bin):
+
------------
# nvme wdc get-pfail-dump /dev/nvme0
------------
* Gets the pfail crash dump from the device and saves to defined file in current directory 
(e.g. testSTM00019F3F9_pfail_dump.bin):
+
------------
# nvme wdc get-pfail-dump /dev/nvme0 -o test
------------
* Gets the pfail crash dump from the device and saves to defined file with pathname (e.g. /tmp/testSTM00019F3F9_pfail_dump.bin):
+
