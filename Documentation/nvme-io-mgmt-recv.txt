SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme io-mgmt-recv' <device> [--namespace-id=<NUM> | -n <NUM>]
			[--mos=<NUM> | -s <NUM>] [--mo=<NUM> | -m <NUM>]
			[--data=<FILE> | -d <FILE>]
			[--data-len=<NUM> | -l <NUM>]
			[--output-format=<fmt> | -o <fmt>] [--verbose | -v]
			[--timeout=<timeout> | -t <timeout>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, issues the I/O Management Receive command with the
requested management operation (mo) and management operation specific parameter
(mos). This is the generic interface provided for forward compatibility as new
operations are added that this program isn't aware of at the time of its
development. As such, this is a generic command that does not do any additional
decoding for specific types of data received. This will only report the data as
a hex dump, or binary.

OPTIONS
-------
-n <NUM>::
--namespace-id=<NUM>::
	Use the provided namespace id for the command. If not provided, the
	namespace id of the block device will be used. If the command is issued
	to a non-block device, the parameter is required.

-d <FILE>::
--data=<FILE>::
	File to write received data into. If unspecified, received data will be
	hex dumped to the standard output stream.

-l <NUM>::
--data-len=<NUM>::
	Received data buffer length

-m <NUM>::
--mo <NUM>::
	Management Operation to perform.

-s <NUM>::
--mos=<NUM>::
	Management Operation Specific parameter.

-o <fmt>::
--output-format=<fmt>::
	Set the reporting format to 'normal', 'json' or 'binary'. Only one
	output format can be used at a time.

-v::
--verbose::
	Increase the information detail in the output.

-t <timeout>::
