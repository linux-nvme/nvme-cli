nvme-intel-market-name - Send NVMe Identify Controller, return result and structure

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme intel market-name' <device> [--raw-binary | -b]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, retrieves intel vendor specific marketing name
log page and provides the result and returned structure. The output is
simply the marketing name used to identify what kind of device it is.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the structure may be returned in one of several ways depending
on the option flags; the structure may be parsed by the program or the
raw buffer may be printed to stdout.

OPTIONS
