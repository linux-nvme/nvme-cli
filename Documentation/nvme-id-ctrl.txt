NAME
----
nvme-id-ctrl - Send NVMe Identify Controller, return result and structure

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme id-ctrl' <device> [-v | --vendor-specific] [-b | --raw-binary]
			[-o <fmt> | --output-format=<fmt>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, sends an identify controller command and
provides the result and returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the structure may be returned in one of several ways depending
on the option flags; the structure may be parsed by the program or the
raw buffer may be printed to stdout.

OPTIONS
-------
-b::
--raw-binary::
	Print the raw buffer to stdout. Structure is not parsed by
	program. This overrides the vendor specific and human readable options.

-v::
--vendor-specific::
	In addition to parsing known fields, this option will dump
	the vendor specific region of the structure in hex with ascii
	interpretation.

-H::
--human-readable::
	This option will parse and format many of the bit fields
	into human-readable formats.

-o <format>::
--output-format=<format>::
              Set the reporting format to 'normal', 'json', or
              'binary'. Only one output format can be used at a time.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Has the program interpret the returned buffer and display the known
fields in a human readable format:
+
------------
# nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0
------------
+

* In addition to showing the known fields, has the program to display
the vendor unique field:
+
------------
# nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0 --vendor-specific
# nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0 -v
------------
+
The above will dump the 'vs' buffer in hex since it doesn't know how to
interpret it.

* Have the program return the raw structure in binary:
+
------------
# nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0 --raw-binary > id_ctrl.raw
# nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0 -b > id_ctrl.raw
------------
+
It is probably a bad idea to not redirect stdout when using this mode.

* Alternatively you may want to send the data to another program that
can parse the raw buffer.
+
------------
# nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0 --raw-binary | nvme_parse_id_ctrl
------------
+
The parse program in the above example can be a program that shows the
structure in a way you like. The following program is such an example
that will parse it and can accept the output through a pipe, `'|'`,
as shown in the above example, or you can `'cat'` a saved output buffer to it.
