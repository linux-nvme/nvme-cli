.RE
.PP
\-o <format>, \-\-output\-format=<format>
.RS 4
Set the reporting format to

.sp
Number of host read commands that were stalled due to a lack of resources within the SSD during the reporting period (NAND flash command queue full, low cache page count, cache page contention, etc\&.)\&. Commands are not considered stalled if the only reason for the delay was waiting for the data to be physically read from the NAND flash\&. It is normal to expect this count to equal zero on heavily utilized systems\&.
T}
T{

\fBHost Read Commands Stalled Percentage\fR

Percentage of read commands that were stalled\&. If the figure is consistently high, then consideration should be given to spreading the data across multiple SSDs\&.

\fBHost Write Odd Start Commands\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Number of host write commands that started on a non\-aligned boundary during the reporting period\&. The size of the boundary alignment is normally 4K; therefore this returns the number of commands that started on a non\-4K aligned boundary\&. The SSD requires slightly more time to process non\-aligned write commands than it does to process aligned write commands\&.
T}

\fBHost Write Odd Start Commands Percentage\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Percentage of host write commands that started on a non\-aligned boundary\&. If this figure is equal to or near 100%, and the NAND Read Before Write value is also high, then the user should investigate the possibility of offsetting the file system\&. For Microsoft Windows systems, the user can use Diskpart\&. For Unix\-based operating systems, there is normally a method whereby file system partitions can be placed where required\&.

T}
T{
.sp
\fBHost Write Commands Stalled\fR
T}:T{
.sp
Number of host write commands that were stalled due to a lack of resources within the SSD during the reporting period\&. The most likely cause is that the write data was being received faster than it could be saved to the NAND flash memory\&. If there was a large volume of read commands being processed simultaneously, then other causes might include the NAND flash command queue being full, low cache page count, or cache page contention, etc\&. It is normal to expect this count to be non\-zero on heavily utilized systems\&.

Number of read commands issued to the NAND devices during the reporting period\&. This figure will normally be much higher than the host read commands figure, as the data needed to satisfy a single host read command may be spread across several NAND flash devices\&.

This is the number of read before write operations that were required to process non\-aligned host write commands during the reporting period\&.
