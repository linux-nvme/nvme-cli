NAME
----
nvme-intel-lat-stats - Send NVMe Identify Controller, return result and structure

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme intel lat-stats' <device> [--write | -w] [--raw-binary | -b]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, retrieves intel vendor specific latency statistics and
provides the result and returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the structure may be returned in one of several ways depending
on the option flags; the structure may be parsed by the program or the
raw buffer may be printed to stdout.

OPTIONS
-------
-b::
--raw-binary::
	Print the raw buffer to stdout. Structure is not parsed by
	program. This overrides the vendor specific and human readable options.

-w::
--write::
	Get write statistics. Read statistics are returned by default.
