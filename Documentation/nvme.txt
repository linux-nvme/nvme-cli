NAME
----
nvme - the NVMe storage command line interface utility (nvme-cli)

SYNOPSIS
--------
built-in plugin:
[verse]
'nvme' <command> <device> [<args>]

extension plugins:
[verse]
'nvme' <plugin> <command> <device> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
NVM-Express is a fast, scalable host controller interface designed to
address the needs for not only PCI Express based solid state drives, but
also NVMe-oF(over fabrics).

This 'nvme' program is a user space utility to provide standards compliant
tooling for NVM-Express drives. It was made specifically for Linux as
it relies on the IOCTLs defined by the mainline kernel driver.

NVME COMMANDS
-------------
The utility has sub-commands for all admin and io commands defined in the
specification and for displaying controller registers. There is also an
option to submit completely arbitrary commands. For a list of commands
available, run "nvme help".
