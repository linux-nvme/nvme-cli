SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme zns zone-mgmt-recv' <device> [--namespace-id=<NUM> | -n <NUM>]
				   [--start-lba=<LBA> | -s <LBA>]
				   [--data-len=<IONUM>, -l <IONUM>]
				   [--zra=<NUM>, -z <NUM>]
				   [--zrasf=<NUM>, -a <NUM>]
				   [--zra-spec-feat, -f]
				   [--output-format=<FMT>, -o <FMT>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, issues the Zone Management Receive command with the
requested receive action and additional action specific parameters. This is the
generic interface provided for forward compatibility as new actions are created
that this program isn't aware of at the time of its development. As such, this
is a generic command that does not do any additional decoding for specific
types of data received. This will only report the data as a hex dump, or
binary. 

OPTIONS
-------
-n <NUM>::
--namespace-id=<NUM>::
	Use the provided namespace id for the command. If not provided, the
	namespace id of the block device will be used. If the command is issued
	to a non-block device, the parameter is required.

-s <lba>::
--start-lba=<lba>::
	The starting LBA of the zone to manage receive.

--data-len=<NUM>
-l <NUM>
	Received data buffer length

-z <NUM>::
--zra=<NUM>::
