==============================

NAME
----
nvme-pred-lat-event-agg-log - Send Predictable Latency Event Aggregate Log
Page request, returns result and log

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme pred-lat-event-agg-log' <device> [--log-entries=<log_entries> | -e <log_entries>]
			[--rae | -r] [--raw-binary | -b]
			[--output-format=<fmt> | -o <fmt>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves the NVMe Predictable Latency Event Aggregate Log Page from an
NVMe device and provides the returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the returned Predictable Latency Event Aggregate Log
Page structure may be returned in one ofseveral ways depending on
the option flags; the structure may parsed by the program and printed
in a readable format or the raw buffer may be printed to stdout for
another program to parse.

OPTIONS
-------
-e <log_entries>::
--log-entries=<log_entries>::
    Retrieve the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate Log pending entries.
    This argument is mandatory and its success may depend on the device's
    statistics to provide this log For More details see NVM Express 1.4 Spec.
    Section 5.14.1.11. The maximum number of log entries supported is 2044
    for the device.

-r::
--rae::
	Retain an Asynchronous Event.

-b::
--raw-binary::
	Print the raw Predectible Latency Event Aggregate log buffer to stdout.

-o <format>::
--output-format=<format>::
    Set the reporting format to 'normal', 'json', or 'binary'.
    Only one output format can be used at a time.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Print the Predictable Latency Event Aggregate Log page in a human readable format:
+
------------
# nvme pred-lat-event-agg-log /dev/nvme0
------------
+

* Print the raw Predectible Latency Event Aggregate log to a file:
+
------------
# nvme pred-lat-event-agg-log /dev/nvme0 --raw-binary > pred_lat_agg_log.raw
------------
+
It is probably a bad idea to not redirect stdout when using this mode.
