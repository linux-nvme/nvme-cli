NAME
----
nvme-smart-log-add - Send NVMe SMART log additional page request, returns result and log

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme smart-log-add' <device> [ --namespace-id=<nsid> | -n <nsid> ]
			[ --raw-binary | -b ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves an additional NVMe SMART log page from an NVMe device and provides the returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

On success, the returned log structure may be returned in one of
several ways depending on the option flags; the structure may parsed by
the program and printed in a readable format or the raw buffer may be
printed to stdout for another program to parse.

OPTIONS
-------
-n <nsid>::
--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Retrieve the additional SMART log for the given nsid. This is
	optional and its success may depend on the device's capabilities
	to provide this log on a per-namespace basis (see the NVMe
	Identify Controller for this capability). The defualt nsid to
	use is 0xffffffff for the device global SMART log.

-b::
--raw-binary::
	Print the raw SMART log buffer to stdout.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Print the SMART log page in a human readable format:
+
------------
# nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0
------------
+

* Print the raw SMART log to a file:
+
------------
# nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0 --raw-binary > fw_log.raw
------------
+
It is probably a bad idea to not redirect stdout when using this mode.
