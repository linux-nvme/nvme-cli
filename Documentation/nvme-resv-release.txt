-----------
The Reservation Release command is used to release or clear a reservation
held on a namespace.

--namespace-id=<nsid>::
	Override the nsid field. If using the admin character device,
	this parameter is required.

--crkey=<crkey>::
	Current Reservation Key: If the Reservation Register Action is
	001b (i.e., Unregister Reservation Key) or 010b (i.e., Replace
	Reservation Key), then this field contains the current reservation

	bit is set to ‘1’.
