SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme device-self-test' <device> [--namespace-id=<NUM> | -n <NUM>]
			[--self-test-code=<NUM> | -s <NUM>] 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Initiates the required test based on the user input.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character

         2h: Start a extended device self-test operation
         eh: Start a vendor specific device self-test operation
         fh: abort the device self-test operation
