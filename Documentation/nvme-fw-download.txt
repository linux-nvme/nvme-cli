nvme-fw-download(1)
===================

NAME
----
nvme-fw-download - Download all or a portion of an nvme firmware image.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme fw-download' <device> [--fw=<firmware-file> | -f <firmware-file>]
		    [--xfer=<transfer-size> | -x <transfer-size>]
		    [--offset=<offset> | -o <offset>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Firmware Image Download command is used to download all or a portion
of the firmware image for a future update to the controller. The Firmware
Image Download command may be submitted while other commands on the Admin
Submission Queue or I/O Submission Queues are outstanding. The Firmware
Image Download command copies the new firmware image (in whole or in part)
to the controller.

The firmware image may be constructed of multiple pieces that
are individually downloaded with separate Firmware Image Download
commands. Each Firmware Image Download command includes a Dword
Offset and Number of Dwords that specify a Dword range. The host
software shall ensure that firmware pieces do not have Dword ranges
that overlap. Firmware portions may be submitted out of order to the
controller.

The new firmware image is not applied as part of the Firmware Image
Download command. It is applied following a reset, where the image to
apply and the firmware slot it should be committed to is specified with
the Firmware Commit command (nvme fw-commit <args>).

OPTIONS
-------
-f <firmware-file>::
--fw=<firmeware-file>::
	Required argument. This specifies the path to the device's
	firmware file on your system that will be read by the program
	and sent to the device.

-x <transfer-size>::
--xfer=<transfer-size>::
	This specifies the size to split each transfer. This is useful if
	the device has a max transfer size requirement for firmware. It
	defaults to 4k.

-o <offset>::
--offset=<offset>::
	This specifies the starting offset in dwords. This is really only
	useful if your firmware is split in multiple files; otherwise
	the offset starts at zero and automatically adjusts based on the
	'xfer' size given.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Transfer a firmware size 128KiB at a time:
