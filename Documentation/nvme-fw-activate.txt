nvme-fw-activate(1)
===================

NAME
----
nvme-fw-activate - Verify downloaded firmware image and commit to specific firmware slot

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme fw-activate' <device> [ --slot=<slot> | -s <slot> ] [ --action=<action> | -a <action> ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, send an NVMe Firmware Activate admin command
and provides the results.

The Firmware Activate command is used to verify that a valid firmware
image has been downloaded and to commit that revision to a specific
firmware slot. The host may select the firmware image to activate on the
next controller reset (CC.EN transitions from ‘1’ to ‘0’, a PCI
function level reset, and/or other Controller or NVM Subsystem Reset)
as part of this command. The currently executing firmware revision may
be determined from the Firmware Revision field of the Identify Controller
data structure as indicated in the Firmware Slot Information log page.

No further action is automatically taken to reset the device, which is
usually required to complete the activation process. If your kernel and
NVMe driver are recent enough, you can activate the firmware by issuing a
reset through Linux sysfs, for example:

------------
 # echo 1 > /sys/class/misc/nvme0/device/reset
------------

If your kernel is not recent enough, you will need to remove and add
the device some other way.
