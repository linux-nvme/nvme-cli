===================

NAME
----
nvme-wdc-id-ctrl - Send NVMe Identify Controller, return result and structure

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nvme wdc id-ctrl' <device> [-v | --vendor-specific] [-b | --raw-binary]
			[-H | --human-readable]
			[-o <fmt> | --output-format=<fmt>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For the NVMe device given, sends an identify controller command and
provides the result and returned structure.

The <device> parameter is mandatory and may be either the NVMe character
device (ex: /dev/nvme0), or a namespace block device (ex: /dev/nvme0n1).

This will only work on WDC devices supporting this feature.
Results for any other device are undefined.

On success, the structure may be returned in one of several ways depending
on the option flags; the structure may be parsed by the program or the
raw buffer may be printed to stdout.

If having the program decode the output for readability, this version
will decode WDC vendor unique portions of the structure.

OPTIONS
-------
-b::
--raw-binary::
	Print the raw buffer to stdout. Structure is not parsed by
	program. This overrides the vendor specific and human readable options.

-v::
--vendor-specific::
	In addition to parsing known fields, this option will dump
	the vendor specific region of the structure in hex with ascii
	interpretation.

-H::
--human-readable::
	This option will parse and format many of the bit fields
	into human-readable formats.

-o <format>::
--output-format=<format>::
              Set the reporting format to 'normal', 'json', or
              'binary'. Only one output format can be used at a time.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Has the program interpret the returned buffer and display the known
fields in a human readable format:
