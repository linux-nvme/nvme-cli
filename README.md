NVM-Express user space tooling for Linux.

nvme-cli uses meson as build system. In order to build nvme-cli
run following commands

	$ meson .build
	$ ninja -C .build

nvme-cli depends on zlib, json-c and libuuid.

To install, run:

	# meson install -C .build

There is a Makefile wrapper for meson for backwards compatiblily

    $ make
    # make install

RPM build support via Makefile that uses meson

    $ make rpm

If not sure how to use, find the top-level documentation with:

    $ man nvme

Or find a short summary with:

    $ nvme help

  ```
A Debian based package for nvme-cli is currently maintained as a
Ubuntu PPA. To install nvme-cli using this approach please perform the following
steps:
   1. Perform an update of your repository list:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
   2. Get nvme-cli!
   ```
   sudo apt-get install nvme-cli
   ```
   3. Test the code.
   ```
   sudo nvme list
   ```
   In the case of no NVMe devices you will see
   ```
   No NVMe devices detected.
   ```
   otherwise you will see information about each NVMe device installed
   in the system.

### OpenEmbedded/Yocto

TBD

## Developers

You may wish to add a new command or possibly an entirely new plug-in
for some special extension outside the spec.

This project provides macros that help generate the code for you. If
you're interested in how that works, it is very similar to how trace
events are created by Linux kernel's 'ftrace' component.

### Add command to existing built-in

The first thing to do is define a new command entry in the command
list. This is declared in nvme-builtin.h. Simply append a new "ENTRY" into
the list. The ENTRY normally takes three arguments: the "name" of the 
subcommand (this is what the user will type at the command line to invoke
your command), a short help description of what your command does, and the
name of the function callback that you're going to write. Additionally,
You can declare an alias name of subcommand with fourth argument, if needed.

After the ENTRY is defined, you need to implement the callback. It takes
four arguments: argc, argv, the command structure associated with the
callback, and the plug-in structure that contains that command. The
prototype looks like this:

  ```c
  int f(int argc, char **argv, struct command *cmd, struct plugin *plugin);
  ```

The argc and argv are adjusted from the command line arguments to start
after the sub-command. So if the command line is "nvme foo --option=bar",
the argc is 1 and argv starts at "--option".

You can then define argument parsing for your sub-command's specific
options then do some command specific action in your callback.

### Add a new plugin

The nvme-cli provides macros to make define a new plug-in simpler. You
can certainly do all this by hand if you want, but it should be easier
to get going using the macros. To start, first create a header file
to define your plugin. This is where you will give your plugin a name,
description, and define all the sub-commands your plugin implements.

There is a very important order on how to define the plugin. The following
is a basic example on how to start this:

File: foo-plugin.h
```c
#undef CMD_INC_FILE
#define CMD_INC_FILE plugins/foo/foo-plugin

#if !defined(FOO) || defined(CMD_HEADER_MULTI_READ)
#define FOO

#include "cmd.h"

PLUGIN(NAME("foo", "Foo plugin"),
	COMMAND_LIST(
		ENTRY("bar", "foo bar", bar)
		ENTRY("baz", "foo baz", baz)
		ENTRY("qux", "foo quz", qux)
	)
);

#endif

#include "define_cmd.h"
```

In order to have the compiler generate the plugin through the xmacro
expansion, you need to include this header in your source file, with
pre-defining macro directive to create the commands.

To get started from the above example, we just need to define "CREATE_CMD"
and include the header:

File: foo-plugin.c
```c
#include "nvme.h"

#define CREATE_CMD
#include "foo-plugin.h"
```

After that, you just need to implement the functions you defined in each
ENTRY, then append the object file name to the meson.build "sources".

## meson tips

In case meson doesn't find libnvme header files (via pkg-config) it 
will fallback using subprojects.  meson checks out libnvme in 
subprojects directory as git tree once to the commit level specified 
in the libnvme.wrap file revision parm.  After this initial checkout,
the libnvme code level will not change unless explicitly told.  That 
means if the current branch is updated via git, the subprojects/libnvme
branch will not updated accordingly.  To update it, either use the 
normal git operations or the command: 

    $ meson subprojects update

## Dependency

libnvme depends on the /sys/class/nvme-subsystem interface which was
introduced in the Linux kernel release v4.15. Hence nvme-cli 2.x is
only working on kernels >= v4.15. For older kernels nvme-cli 1.x is
recommended to be used.
